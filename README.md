# MyFirstUnityGame

A very simple unity game, just testing stuff out. 

Right click circles, left click squares. 

You must click the cylinder enemies multiple times. 

Press space to switch between warm or cool colors, the shapes can only be killed if the background is matching the color temperature of the shape.
